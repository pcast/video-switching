1
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,826
The Solar system. Our home in space.

2
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:12,271
We live in a peaceful
part of the Milky Way.

3
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,483
Our home is the Solar system,

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:20,556
a 4.5-billion-year-old formation that
races around the galactic centre at

5
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:27,928
200,000 km/h and circles it
once every 250 million years.

6
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,536
Our star, the Sun, is at the centre
of the Solar system.

7
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:35,857
It’s orbited by eight planets,

8
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:39,804
trillions of asteroids and comets and a
few dwarf planets.

9
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,855
The eight planets. Divided into four
planets like ours:

10
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:47,177
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

11
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:51,976
and four gas giants:
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

12
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:56,959
Mercury is the smallest and
lightest of all the planets.

13
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:00,416
A Mercury year is shorter than the Mercury
day, which leads to

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,334
enormous fluctuations in temperature.

15
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:06,728
Mercury does not have an
atmosphere or a moon.

16
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:11,997
Venus is one of the brightest objects in
the Solar system and by far

17
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:15,433
the hottest planet, with atmospheric
pressure that is

18
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,618
92 times higher than on Earth.

19
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:23,813
An out-of-control greenhouse effect
means that Venus never

20
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:26,726
cools below 437 °C.

21
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,169
Venus also doesn’t have a moon.

22
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,691
Earth is our home and the only planet

23
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:39,820
with temperatures that are moderate enough
to allow for a surplus of liquid water.

24
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:44,673
Furthermore, it’s so far the only place
where life is known to exist.

25
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,921
The Earth has one moon.

26
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,867
Mars is the second smallest planet
in the Solar system

27
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,893
and hardly massive enough to keep a very
thin atmosphere.

28
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,781
Its Olympus Mons is the largest
mountain in the Solar system,

29
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:02,563
more than three times as high as Mount
Everest.

30
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,012
Mars has two small moons.

31
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:12,278
Jupiter is the largest and most massive
planet in the Solar system.

32
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:15,571
It consists largely of hydrogen and
helium

33
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,218
and is the theatre for the largest and
most powerful storms we know.

34
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:25,082
Its largest storm, the Great Red Spot,
is three times as large as Earth.

35
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,288
Jupiter has sixty-seven moons.

36
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:33,411
Saturn is the second largest planet and
possesses the smallest density

37
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,489
of all the planets.

38
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,912
If you had a sufficiently large bathtub,
Saturn would swim in it.

39
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,988
Saturn is also known for its extended,
very visible ring system.

40
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,113
It has sixty-two moons.

41
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:51,602
Uranus is the third largest planet
and one of the coldest.

42
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:55,121
Of all the gas giants, it’s also
the smallest.

43
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,715
The special thing about Uranus is that
its axis of rotation

44
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:02,427
is tilted sideways in contrast to the
seven other planets.

45
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,641
It has twenty-seven moons.

46
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:10,494
Neptune is the last planet in the Solar
system and is similar to Uranus.

47
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:16,198
It’s so far removed from the Sun that
a Neptune year is 164 Earth years long.

48
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,700
The highest wind speed ever measured
was in a storm on Neptune,

49
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:24,588
at just under 2,100 km/h.

50
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,625
Neptune has fourteen moons.

51
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:34,458
If we compare the sizes of the planets,

52
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,177
the differences between them
become even clearer.

53
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,382
Jupiter is the leader in terms of
size and weight;

54
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,540
small Mercury, on the other hand,

55
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:47,536
is even smaller than one of Jupiter’s
moons, Ganymede.

56
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:53,128
Jupiter is so massive that alone it
contains roughly 70% of the mass

57
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:56,954
of all the other planets and has a massive
impact on its surroundings.

58
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:01,401
That’s a blessing for Earth, since
Jupiter draws most of

59
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:05,147
the dangerously large asteroids
that could wipe out life on Earth.

60
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:11,606
But even Jupiter is a dwarf in
comparison to our star, the Sun.

61
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:15,201
Calling it massive does not do
justice to the Sun.

62
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:19,789
It makes up 99.86% of the mass
in our Solar system.

63
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,881
For the most part, it consists of
hydrogen and helium.

64
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:28,288
Only less than 2% is made up of
heavy elements, like oxygen or iron.

65
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:34,717
At its core, the Sun fuses 620 million
tons of hydrogen each second

66
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:39,410
and generates enough energy to satisfy
mankind’s needs for years.

67
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:43,100
But not only the eight planets
orbit our Sun.

68
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:46,992
Trillions of asteroids and comets
also circle it.

69
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,061
Most of them are concentrated into
two belts:

70
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,607
the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter

71
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,596
and the Kuiper belt at the edge of the
Solar system.

72
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,530
These belts are home to countless
objects, some as large as a dust particle,

73
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,155
others the size of dwarf planets.

74
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,176
The most well-known object in the
asteroid belt is Ceres;

75
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:15,093
the most well-known objects in the Kuiper
belt are Pluto, Makemake and Haumea.

76
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:18,984
Usually we describe the asteroid belt as

77
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,686
a dense collection of bodies that
constantly collide.

78
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,600
But in fact, the asteroids are
distributed across an area that is

79
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:30,707
so indescribably large that it’s even
difficult to see two asteroids at once.

80
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,843
Despite the billions of objects in them,

81
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:37,560
the asteroid belts are fairly empty
places.

82
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,154
And nonetheless, there are collisions
over and over again.

83
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,738
The mass of both belts is also
unimpressive:

84
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:49,938
the asteroid belt has a little less than
4% of our Moon’s mass, and

85
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:53,863
the Kuiper belt is only between one 25th
and one 10th of Earth’s mass.

86
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,648
One day, the Solar system will cease to
exist.

87
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:04,630
The Sun will die, and Mercury, Venus and
maybe Earth too will be destroyed.

88
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:10,646
In 500 million years it will become hotter
and hotter until at some point

89
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:13,109
it will melt Earth’s crust.

90
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:18,262
Then the Sun will grow and grow and
either swallow Earth

91
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,525
or at least turn it into a sea of lava.

92
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:27,558
When it has burnt up all its fuel and
lost most of its mass,

93
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:32,152
it will shrink to a white dwarf and burn
gently for a few billion more years

94
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:35,164
before it goes out entirely.

95
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:40,541
Then, at the latest, life in the Solar
system will no longer be possible.

96
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,460
The Milky Way will not even notice it.

97
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,120
A small part of it in one of its arms
will become just a tiny bit darker.

98
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:54,094
And mankind will cease to exist
or leave the Solar system

99
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,721
in search of a new home.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
